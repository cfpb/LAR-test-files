## RegTech Test Files

This is a repo that contains test files that can be used to explore various parts of the Small Business Lending (SBL or 1071) beta platform. There are two different subfolders within the sbl folder - demo_files and dev_files. Their respective readmes have additional detail, but here's a high-level overview of their contents.

### demo_files

These are files that are designed to be used to explore different testing scenarios on the SBL beta platform and to help users navigate through different stages of the platform. 


### dev_files

These are files that can be used to explore different testing scenarios on the SBL beta platform but more generally exist to show the structure of files that will and will not pass the SBL platform validation checks. 

- Each folder contains output of the [Mock Data Generator](https://github.com/cfpb/regtech-mock-data-generator).
- These files can be used with the SBL beta platform or with the [SBL data validator](https://github.com/cfpb/regtech-data-validator).
